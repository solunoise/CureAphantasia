# Thinking Styles

• **Amodal Thinking** - Raw thoughts not tied to any sensory processes, and are the pure "understanding" of something (AKA psychonetics pure meanings).

• **Sensory Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on sensorial processes (ie Sight, Taste, Touch, Sound, Smell).

• **Verbal Thinking** - Sound-based sensory thinking specialized for linguistic expression.

• **Conceptual Thinking** - Subcategory of Sensory Thinking for other specialized types of thinking (eg Spatial, Orientation, Motion, etc).

• **Emotional Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on emotional feelings. (note from Sol - I think this term may be redundant. You feel emotions, you don't think emotions, your thoughts may lead to emotions, or your emotions may lead to thoughts, overall I just don't see where this term could be useful, though I might just be ignorant)

# Mental Mechanisms

• **Mental Functions* - Mental Mechanisms your brain utilizes to transform information. Active: transforms thinking into conscious experiences. Passive: background processes like transforming electric signals from light hitting your eyes into actually seeing.

• **Visualization** - The general category for manifesting sensory experiences from thoughts. Generally, this term refers to the visual part of visualization, but depending on the context it can refer to other sensorial processes or several sensorial processes as a whole. Visualization is Mental Function for manifesting Sensory/Conceptual thinking into sensory experiences, as in willful hallucinations (vividness depends on type of visualization)

• **Minds Eye** - A medium through which you actually "see" Visualization. This is the medium most people begin with. the Minds Eye is an internal "eye" which you look at Visualization through. Visualizations through this medium do not overlap with your actual vision, its as if you have another eye in another dimension and you are looking through it.

• **Prophantasia** - Manifestation of Visualization which you can see in your actual vision. This (and probably Minds Eye) is a result from interfering in the Mental Function of vision, there are several layers of processing which you can infiltrate to gain Prophantasia, and depending on which layer you infiltrate you get slightly different effects.

• **Inner Monologue** - Type of Visualization. A Mental Function for manifesting Verbal Thinking. Transforms verbal thoughts into "hearing" those thoughts as if someone is speaking them out loud (though its not as vivid as literal hearing in most cases). (This redundant definition is only included because its a commonly known term)
