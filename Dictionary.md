# Thinking Styles

• **Verbal Thinking** - Silent thoughts which are structured like sentences.

• **Sensory Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on sensorial processes (ie Sight, Taste, Touch, Sound, Smell).

• **Conceptual Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on the latent properties of platonic domains (eg Spatial, Orientation, Motion)
