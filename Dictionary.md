# Thinking Styles

• **Verbal Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on language.

• **Sensory Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on sensorial processes (ie Sight, Taste, Touch, Sound, Smell).

• **Conceptual Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on latent platonic properties (eg Spatial, Orientation, Motion, etc).

# Mental Mechanisms

• **Inner Monologue** - A Mental Mechanism for hosting Verbal Thinking. The Inner Monologue can be activated conciously or unconcsiously, and can have parallel instances (ie '_inner dialogue_', wherein multiple Inner Monologues overlap). Inner Monologue primarily hosts Verbal Thinking, and can synergize with Sensory Thinking (specifically _Sound Sensory Thinking_) to 'attach' voices to Verbal Thoughts.
