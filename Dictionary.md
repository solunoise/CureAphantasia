• **Conceptual Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on latent platonic properties (eg Spatial, Orientation, Motion, etc).

# Mental Mechanisms

• **Inner Monologue** - A form of thinking based on language. This can occur conciously or unconcsiously, and can occur in parallel ('_inner dialogue_', wherein multiple linguistic thoughts overlap). This is a form of Verbal Thinking and can also optionally work together with Sensory Thinking (specifically _Sound Sensory Thinking_) to create a literal audible voice or voices internally, or may be 'silent' with no sensory component.

• **Minds Eye** - _TBD (Note, sub-component of the `Theater of the Mind`)_

• **Theater of the Mind** - _TBD_

# Mental Processes
