# Thinking Styles

• **Verbal Thinking** - Silent thoughts which are structured like sentences.

• **Sensory Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on sensorial processes (ie Sight, Taste, Touch, Sound, Smell).

• **Conceptual Thinking** - Thoughts which are structured based on the latent properties of platonic domains (eg Spatial, Orientation, Motion)

# Mental Mechanisms

• **Inner Monologue** - A form of thinking based on language. This can occur conciously or unconcsiously, and can occur in parallel ('_inner dialogue_', wherein multiple linguistic thoughts overlap). This is a form of Verbal Thinking and can also optionally work together with Sensory Thinking (specifically _Sound Sensory Thinking_) to create a literal audible voice or voices internally, or may be 'silent' with no sensory component.

• **Minds Eye** -

# Mental Processes

• **Imposition** - (terminology may change ['warping' vs 'projecting' maybe?])

• **Projection** - (super-imposition)
